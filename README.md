### Exercise 8
Create a new component called AlienCharacter. In AlienCharacter, create a form that will allow the user to input an alien character's name, planet, size, and type. Once submitted, it should add the details to an array of collections. Create an additional button in your AlienCharacter component called COMPLETE that will pass the array to a new child component called DisplayAliens. DisplayAliens should use JSX to style each collection from the passed array.
